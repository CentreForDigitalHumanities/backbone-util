## Rationale



## Quickstart

If you have a workflow in which you install dependencies from [npm](https://npmjs.com/) and possibly bundle them with some kind of tool:

``` bash
// could also use yarn, pnpm, etcetera
npm add @uu-cdh/backbone-util
```

``` javascript
```

Alternatively, if you are directly using the library as a browser embed:

``` html
<script type="module">
</script>
```

## Compatibility

The code modules use modern `import`/`export` syntax. If your target environment does not support this, you will need to take the code through a conversion or bundling tool first. Otherwise, only syntax is used that has existed for a while, so no transpilation or polyfilling should be required.
